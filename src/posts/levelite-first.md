# Patch Notes Version 1.0.0 - Early Access

Hey Hunters!

We are thrilled to introduce **Version 1.0.0 - Early Access** of Levelite. In this update, we’ve bundled a host of new features, improvements, and fixes designed to make your gaming experience even more immersive and challenging. Read on for all the details of this major release:

---

## 1. Interface and Usability

- **Visual Refactoring:**  
  We made subtle tweaks to the interface to ensure it’s cleaner, more organized, and intuitive. All elements have been rearranged to simplify navigation and enhance your understanding of the game.

- **Tutorials on Every Page:**  
  We’ve added step-by-step tutorials across all sections of the game. Whether you’re new or a veteran, these guides will help you understand every feature clearly and practically.

---

## 2. Tasks and Missions

- **Cooperative Tasks:**  
  You can now create cooperative tasks! Invite one or more friends to tackle daily challenges together, fostering a more collaborative and social gameplay experience.

- **Personalized Daily Missions:**  
  We revamped the daily tasks so they better adapt to your profile. Each mission is designed to be both relevant and challenging, encouraging you to hit your daily goals.

- **XP Adjustment:**  
  The XP awarded per mission and roadmap has been significantly reduced, making leveling up more challenging. However, with every level gained, the rewards increase substantially to truly honor your progress.

---

## 3. Skillbooks and Skill Progression

- **Skillbook Leveling System:**  
  Skillbooks no longer grant XP directly to the player. Instead, each skillbook now has its own XP system, allowing you to track your true progress in the desired skill. When you create a skillbook, a detailed plan from level 1 to 30 is generated to guide your development.

- **Plan-Based Task Generation:**  
  Rather than relying on random tasks, skillbook missions now follow a pre-established plan. This ensures that each challenge consistently contributes to your overall progress.

- **Skillbook Sharing:**  
  Share the skillbook models you create with the community, and browse models developed by other players. This feature promotes a rich exchange of strategies and experiences.

## 4. Items, Equipment, and Crafting

- **New Items and Equipment:**  
  In Levelite, you’ll now find a variety of equippable items such as weapons, armors, amulets, and more. Each item offers unique bonuses—whether it’s increased damage, defense, XP, or other key attributes—to support you on your journey.

  - **Unique Items (Artifacts):**  
    We’ve introduced a system for unique items, known as artifacts. These items are exclusive to a single player until traded or sold, adding a special value to the game’s most powerful equipment.

- **Crafting System:**  
  Crafting items is now even more exciting! With the new crafting system, you can produce a wide range of items from ingredients collected while leveling up or exploring roadmaps and dungeons. The recipes are kept secret, encouraging collaboration and discovery among players.

---

## 5. Guild of Adventurers

- **New "Guild of Adventurers" Tab:**  
  We’ve created a dedicated guild section in the menu where you’ll find various missions posted on the guild notice boards, all designed to engage the community:
  
  - **Fixed Roadmap Missions:**  
    Each roadmap now includes a set of missions—whether combat or collection-based—that offer exclusive items and a significant amount of XP when completed.
  
  - **Secret Missions:**  
    Befriend the guild master to unlock secret missions packed with unique challenges and special rewards. The details of these missions will be yours to uncover!

## 6. Combat System

- **More Challenging and Dynamic Combat:**  
  We completely overhauled the combat system to make each battle more intense and strategic:
  
  - **Enemies with Exclusive Abilities:**  
    Enemies now do more than just fixed damage—they can use special abilities, apply buffs, and even heal during battle, which requires you to plan your tactics carefully.
  
  - **No Escape in Combat:**  
    Once engaged in combat, there is no escape—you must fight until you win or are defeated. Although you can continue using the app, if the battle goes on (every 3 hours), you’ll suffer 40% damage to your health, encouraging a swift and decisive finish.

---

## 7. Class Skills

- **Revised and Finalized Class Skills:**  
  We’ve completely reworked the class skills to better suit various play styles:
  
  - **Mindbreaker:**  
    The Mindbreaker is the only class capable of crafting healing and regeneration items. Having a Mindbreaker by your side can be crucial in intense battles and when preparing for tough challenges.
  
  - **Visionary:**  
    With the new "Eye of Providence" ability, the Visionary can, at the cost of some mana, reveal all details about an enemy—its weaknesses, health, abilities, and more—enabling more strategic combat planning.
  
  - **Secret Skills:**  
    All classes now feature secret skills that unlock only upon reaching Rank-S and completing special missions. For example, **Necromancer’s Touch** allows the Shadow class to raise the shadows of defeated enemies as pets. As the Shadow levels up, they can control more pets. Similar secret skills will be available for all classes, letting every player choose their destiny wisely.
  
  - **More Skills:**  
    Additional skills are on the way. Stay tuned to discover all the surprises we have in store!

## 8. New Roadmaps

- **Expanding Challenges:**  
  We’ve added new roadmaps, with many more planned for the coming weeks. These roadmaps offer progressive challenges that will test your skills and ensure continuous growth along your journey.

## 9. Bug Fixes

We’ve implemented several fixes to improve the game’s stability and performance:

- Fixed an issue with tasks not resetting for users who disabled the s-system.
- Adjusted the pet addition process to ensure they are correctly incorporated.
- Resolved the problem of tabs stacking when clicked repeatedly.
- Dungeon XP now contributes correctly to leveling up.
- Addressed the issue of enemy health resetting when returning to combat.
